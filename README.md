# Word-Guess-Game

#### I need to find the logic of this game:
- I need to assign the topic of this game, and I pick a easier one: days in a week
- I will let the computer randomly pick a word from the word list
- I set 12 times of guess that user can guess
- each time they guess wrong they will lose a chance


###Technology I used: 
- HTML
